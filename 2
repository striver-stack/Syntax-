Problem Description
Nimo loves geometry and is tackling a challenge with a grid of rectangular boxes, trying to solve something unique. Let's take a closer look at it.

Given an N × M grid of rectangular gift boxes, partition lines define the boundaries between individual boxes. The task is to place an axis-aligned rectangular block on the grid such that it overlaps exactly K gift boxes, either partially or fully.

The objective is to determine the minimum possible area of such a rectangular block. If it is not possible to cover exactly K boxes, the output should be "Impossible."

Constraints
1 <= N, M <= 50

1 <= L <= 30

0 <= x1, y1, x2, y2 <= 50

1 <= K <= 500

All sections are guaranteed to be rectangles or squares.

Input
The first line contains two space-separated integers N and M, representing the grid dimensions.

The second line contains an integer L, denoting the number of partition lines.

The next L lines each contain four space-separated integers x1, y1, x2, y2, specifying the endpoints of a partition line segment.

The final line contains an integer K, representing the number of gift boxes to be covered.

Output
Output a single integer representing the minimum area of the rectangular block that covers exactly K gift boxes.

If it is not possible to cover exactly K boxes, or if K exceeds the total number of boxes, output "Impossible."

Fig.1

A rectangular block of size 5 × 3, placed with its top-left corner at (0, 4), overlaps exactly 8 gift boxes. The resulting area is 15, which is the minimum possible.

make funct, calculation part up and down to look like a hurry , busy low level coding knowledge man rewrite this code.

use small variable and function name, change structure of code.

remove comments and modify this code that anyone can't find that i have copied
