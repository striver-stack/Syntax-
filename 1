Given two arrays, profit[] and weight[], where each element represents the profit and weight of an item respectively, also given an integer W representing the maximum capacity of the knapsack (the total weight it can hold).
Put the items into the knapsack such that the sum of profits associated with them is the maximum possible, without exceeding the capacity W.

Note: We can either include an item completely or exclude it entirely - we cannot include a fraction of an item.

Examples:

Input:  W = 4, profit[] = [1, 2, 3], weight[] = [4, 5, 1]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are two items which have weight less than or equal to 4. If we select the item with weight 4, the possible profit is 1. And if we select the item with weight 1, the possible profit is 3. So the maximum possible profit is 3. Note that we cannot put both the items with weight 4 and 1 together as the capacity of the bag is 4.

Input: W = 3, profit[] = [1, 2, 3], weight[] = [4, 5, 6]
Output: 0
Explanation: All the item weights are greater than the knapsack capacity.
